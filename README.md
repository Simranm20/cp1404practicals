## About the Author
> I am Simran Mulchandani, a passionate student about Programming and learning 
> about Python. Throughout this subject, I have been actively involved in building and refining 
> Python programs, learning lessons about writing clean and maintainable code. PyCharm 
> has been a great tool, and I have dedicated significant time and effort to ensure the codebase 
> adheres to the principles of "clean code"

## Three Main Lessons Learned about "Clean Code":
> - Consistent and Descriptive Naming
> - Documentation and Comments
> - Simplicity and Readability
