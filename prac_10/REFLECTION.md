# PyCharm Learning Experience

## Estimation Accuracy and Learning Progress
> Throughout the PyCharm course, I frequently engaged in practical tasks that required estimation. Initially,
> my estimation accuracy was moderate, and I occasionally underestimated the time required for some tasks. 
> As the course progressed, I noticed significant improvement in my estimation skills. I learned to break down 
> tasks, consider potential challenges, and allocate time more effectively. This improvement in accuracy was a 
> direct result of both practice and learning from my experiences.

## Code Reviews: Learning from Both Sides
> Participating in code reviews, whether as the author or the reviewer, has been a valuable learning experience.
> When my code was reviewed, I gained valuable insights into alternative approaches, potential pitfalls, and best practices. 
> Constructive feedback from reviewers improved the quality of my code and my understanding of coding conventions.
> Conversely, reviewing code from my peers taught me to critically assess code quality, adherence to style guidelines,
> and the importance of clear documentation.

## Reflection on Practical Tasks
> Looking back, the practical tasks were really helpful because they let me use what I learned in the subject. 
> I could put my theoretical knowledge into practice by solving real problems. If I were in charge of the subject, 
> I might add more projects where students work together or do coding exercises as a team. This way, they could learn
> how to work together and understand how things are done in the real world. Another thing that could help is if there 
> are examples or step-by-step explanations for harder tasks. This way, all students could learn better and understand 
> everything.
